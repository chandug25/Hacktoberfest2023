# Low Level Design of Snake and Ladder

### Low-level design (LLD) is an important part of software development because it provides a detailed blueprint for how the system will be implemented. LLD helps to ensure that the system is well-designed, efficient, and maintainable.

In the context of the Snake and Ladder game, LLD is important for the following reasons:

* To ensure that the game is implemented correctly and that all of the rules are followed.
* To optimize the performance of the game, such as minimizing the number of calculations required to move a player around the board.
* To make the game code more maintainable and easier to update in the future.

The main entities in the game are:

* Game: The Game class is responsible for overall control of the game, including initializing the board, players, and snakes and ladders; rolling the dice; and moving the players around the board.
* Board: The Board class represents the game board, which is a grid of cells. Each cell can be either empty, a snake, or a ladder.
* Player: The Player class represents a player in the game. Each player has a current position on the board.
* Snake: The Snake class represents a snake on the board. A snake has a start cell and an end cell. If a player lands on the start cell of a snake, they must move down to the end cell of the snake.
* Ladder: The Ladder class represents a ladder on the board. A ladder has a start cell and an end cell. If a player lands on the start cell of a ladder, they must move up to the end cell of the ladder.
